                            Zenitsu was not raised by his parents so he did not have any
                            proper guidance. When he was young, Zenitsu fell in love with a girl and
                            decided to give her money to appeal to her, however the girl ended up
                            running away with another guy leaving Zenitsu drowning in debt.

                            abusive father and escaped from his father with his mother.

                            Tanjiro, Inosuke and Zenitsu had no idea what they'd gotten themselves into when they volunteered for Tengen Uzui's mission at the start of Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba's "Entertainment District" arc. The boys joined the Sound Hashira in the city of Yoshiwara to locate Tengen's missing wives and managed to draw out Daki and Gyutaro, the demon siblings who share the title of Upper-Rank Six. Ordinarily, only a Hashira would have even a one-percent chance of surviving a fight with an Upper-Rank. And yet, Tanjiro, Inosuke and Zenitsu looked like Hashira themselves as they played a critical role in the fight, each delivering the final blows for the first death of an Upper-Rank in 100 years.

                            The Hashira are all assigned a specific region that they are required to patrol,
          usually to gather information about the demons inhabiting the said area and to improve their swordsmanship.
          They are also deployed on missions only if members of lower ranks are unable to complete it.
